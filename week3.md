## Week3

### Day15

> Sponge Bob
>
> The frantic pacing -- scence changes every 11 seconds on average, often leaves Kids zoned out and spun up unable to concentrate.

#### Grammer

1. frantic: means loss of control, uncontrollable fast.(crazy)

   I have a frantic day. (very crazy and busy day)

2. pacing: means speed

3. zone out: means lost concentration(mind is gone)

4. spun up: means wound up, you spin out of control, you become crazy.

   You should emphasize the "up", like clean up(completedly clean, shut up(do not say anything). 

#### Rule

1. connect sound (**Whenever we have no consonant, we need to connect**)

   - changes every 11 seconds on average
     - changes+every+11 seconds+on+average
     - ***on***, in USA, most American pronounce it: [a:n]

   - zoned out == zonedout
   - spun up == spunup  

    

2. cancel sound

  - unable to = unable+d(to)

### Day16

> Battered, soaked and flooded; the Philippines is being hit by its second typhoon in a week.

#### Grammer

1. battered: it means constantly hit
2. soaked: it means completely wet with water, rain actually
3. the Philippine: we always keep 'the' here before "Philippine", cause there are many islands, and all of these islands together make the country. (like the United States)

#### Rule

1. connect sound
   - battered: 'red', kind of a quick short 'd'
   - soaked: 'ked', kind of 't'
   - flooded: 'ded', prononce 'd' (the end 'd' can be neglected)
   - second typhoon in a week
     - secon(d)+typhoon
     - typhoon+in+a

#### Read

> Battered, soak(ed)t and flood(ed); the Philippine is being hit by secon(d)+typhoon+in+a week.
