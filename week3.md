## Week3

### Day16

> Battered, soaked and flooded; the Philippines is being hit by its second typhoon in a week.

#### Grammer

1. battered: it means constantly hit
2. soaked: it means completely wet with water, rain actually
3. the Philippine: we always keep 'the' here before "Philippine", cause there are many islands, and all of these islands together make the country. (like the United States)

#### Rule

1. connect sound
   - battered: 'red', kind of a quick short 'd'
   - soaked: 'ked', kind of 't'
   - flooded: 'ded', prononce 'd' (the end 'd' can be neglected)
   - second typhoon in a week
     - secon(d)+typhoon
     - typhoon+in+a
